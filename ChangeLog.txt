	Renamed DLL for CKAN compatibility
	Added AssemblyFileVersion
	Updated version file for 1.12

0.6.10.2

	If bulk slider > 1, then badass and veteran buttons are disabled;

	Thanks to @TonkaCrash for this:
	CustomAstronautComplexUI.cs
		Changed limit of hires to a single constant, was just set to 10 in various places, but logic assumed more than 10 could be hired at a time		
		Randomized stats on bulkhires. Sliders affect average value of stats, 5% chance of a badass. Veteran and Badass buttons are ignored for bulkhires. 
			
	en-us.cfg
		Fixed grammar in Veteran tooltip.

		Randomize stats on bulk hires
		Fixed grammar error in Veteran tooltip.

	Thanks to @cake-pit for these:

0.6.9.1
	Thanks to @TonkaCrash for this:
		Fixed scaling issue

0.6.9
	Thanks to @cake-pie for this:
	Traits.cs

		obtain traits' name (id) & title (display) from ExperienceConfigs already present in GameDatabase instead of fetching raw from config nodes
		remove special case handling that excludes "Unknown"; this probably being leftover artifact from previous attempt that parsed data from CommunityTraitIcons' config file and thus no longer needed
		store traitTitles as List instead of Dictionary
		remove redundant KCareerStrings
		rename KCareerCnt to KCareerPerRow for clarity: this is the number of careers to show per line of the SelectionGrid and not the number of careers installed in the game
		fix KCareerGrid size to number of careers instead of incorrect KCareerCnt, for loop counter fixed to match
		remove unnecessary localization code. TraitTitle.title is already localized (if localization is available) when we obtain it
	
	CustomAstronautComplexUI.cs

		updated to account for changes in Traits.cs
		use identifiers instead of display strings for checking ProtoCrewMember's trait
		use pcm.experienceTrait.Config.Name instead of pcm.experienceTrait.TypeName and pcm.experienceTrait.Title. See here for info.
